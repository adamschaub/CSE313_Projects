    CONSOLE APPLICATION : AdamSchaub_Homework1 Project Overview
========================================================================

AdamSchaub_Homework1.cpp
    This is the main application source file. This implementation draws a five-leaf rose with
    a line trace. The leading point of the trace is white by default and uniformly diminishes
    to black over an arbitrary interval. 

    An extra credit feature has been included. Press 'h' to colorize the graph. The line's
    trailing point is now drawn in blue, then turns a dark shade of purple, reaching the
    leading point as a light shade of purple.
